# Welcome to the Marconi Institute Guides

This portal aims to gather in a single access point all the information, manuals, and procedures necessary to make the most of our school's digital tools.

## Why this site?

The school is facing an important process of modernization and digitization. To support students, teachers, staff, and families in this change, we have created this collection of guides that will accompany you step by step in using the new services.

## What you will find here

The site is organized into sections dedicated to different school users:

*   **Students**: Guides on account activation, use of educational platforms, and study resources.
*   **Teachers and School Staff**: Procedures for the electronic register, digital teaching management, and administrative tools.
*   **Families and Parents**: Instructions for accessing online services, payments, and school-family communications.
*   **Digital Team**: Technical documentation and team projects for school innovation.

## The Context: AGID and Service Design

Our digitization path follows the guidelines of **AGID** (Agency for Digital Italy), focusing on user experience and process simplification.
