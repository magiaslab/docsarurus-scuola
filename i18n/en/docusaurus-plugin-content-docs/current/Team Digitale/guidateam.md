# Publishing guides and tutorials

## How to publish guides and tutorials on this site

## Tools

The site is built on an open source platform called ["docusaurus"](https://docusaurus.io/) and the site is hosted on [github](https://github.com/magiaslab/docsarurus-scuola.git) and distributed through [Netlify](https://app.netlify.com/).

## Writing content

To write a guide or document to be published, it is necessary to write the content through a text file in [markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) format.
This format allows, in addition to normal formatting, the insertion of code, video, and other components such as HTML and more, maintaining small dimensions and loading speed.
To write in markdown, there are several tools also online including:

 - [Stack Edit](https://stackedit.io/)
 - [Pandao](https://pandao.github.io/editor.md/en.html)
 - [Editor](https://markdownlivepreview.com/)
 - [On Line Markdown Editor](https://onlinemarkdowneditor.dev/)

From all editors, you can obviously export the processed file in MD format or even in other formats.

## Publishing on the site

The files of the guides or tutorials written by the members of the Institute's Digital Team must be uploaded to the Team's shared drive in the **"Guide e Tutorial"** folder and will be published on the site from time to time by the person in charge.

## Content requirements

Indicate within the file if the guide and tutorial to be published is intended for:

 - Students
 - Family and parents
 - Teachers and school staff

In order to better organize the content published on the site.
