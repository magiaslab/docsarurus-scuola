## Step-by-step operations

The DidUp Family app is available in stores for both Android and iPhone, you can install it from these links:

- [Link for iOS smartphone](https://apps.apple.com/it/app/didup-famiglia/id1558465752)

To make the first access to the application, you will have to use the temporary credentials provided by the **[secretariat](https://istituto-marconi.edu.it/struttura/segreteria/)** via e-mail or on paper.

Please note that credentials for **"parent"** accounts are issued by the secretariat while **"student"** ones are issued by the class coordinator only for students of lower secondary schools.
