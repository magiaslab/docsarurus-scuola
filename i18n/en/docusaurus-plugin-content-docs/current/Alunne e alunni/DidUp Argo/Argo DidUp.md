# What do I need for the first access?

To perform the first access to the application, you will need to use the **temporary credentials** provided by the school secretariat via e-mail or on paper.

To request credentials, you can send an email to the [secretariat](mailto:%20liic81000c@istruzione.it) or go directly to the offices during opening hours visible at this [link](https://istituto-marconi.edu.it/struttura/segreteria/)

**Credentials are delivered directly to students by class coordinators, refer to them in case of non-delivery.**

We remind you that credentials may differ depending on the type of user:

### Parent Access

-   Verify personal data; consult the school curriculum and the status of school fee payments for their children.
-   Observe absences/delays/permits and justifications by month, by day, by subject and obtain related statistical elaborations; if provided by the school, justify absences for their children.
-   Verify the general progress of their children's profit. View any disciplinary notes.
-   If provided by the school, view the grade board, Intermediate Assessments, and Final Scrutinies;
-   View and print the Digital Report Card, the Report Slip, and the Religion Sheet. Give official confirmation of viewing to the headmaster (also via PIN, if managed by the school);
-   Access class lesson schedules; textbook adoptions;
-   Use the school, teacher, and class bulletin board
-   View the register of daily grades entered by professors through ScuolaNEXT and the topics covered in class (if provided by the Headmaster and teachers);
-   Autonomously manage the booking of teacher meetings.
-   Request the printing of certifications from the school and check their progress status.
-   Do not manage document sharing with teachers (prerogative of STUDENT access)

### Student Access

The access profile dedicated to students differs from that of parents in certain areas:

-   Manage DOCUMENT SHARING functions with teachers.
-   Cannot justify absences, except in the case of adult students (on Alunni Web, the option must have been activated in the registry window).
-   Cannot book interviews with teachers, except in cases where the principal has expressly provided for it, activating the option: allow students to book interviews with teachers.
-   Do not manage the viewing of official documents, nor that of their own disciplinary notes.

**It is therefore necessary that everyone uses their own account correctly**
