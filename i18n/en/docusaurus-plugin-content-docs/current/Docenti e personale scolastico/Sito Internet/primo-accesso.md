# First Access Google Workspace

The first access is an operation that must be performed only for the first activation, it also contains useful indications on how to use a double account in browsers.

The recommended browser for optimal use of the Gsuite platform is Google Chrome.

## 1 Where to make the first access

To access the Gsuite Educational platform for the Marconi Institute, simply go to this link [www.gsuite.istituto-marconi.edu.it](https://mail.google.com/a/istituto-marconi.edu.it)

## 2 Email address

Each person in the school is assigned a personal email address.

All email addresses are created with this convention:

**surname.name@istituto-marconi.edu.it** in this way, knowing the name and surname of the people who live the school, it is equally simple to identify their email address to be able to communicate with them.

Every student and every teacher, as well as the management and secretarial staff, have their own email address according to this convention. The list of users corresponds to that of the electronic register, so the email address is formed exactly by the names and surname present in the register. Any changes to simplify email addresses in case of complex names are possible by sending an email to technical support at this address [admin@istituto-marconi.edu.it](mailto:admin@istituto-marconi.edu.it)

Addresses of services not attributable to a natural person (for example, the secretariat) will be published on the school website.

## 3 First access password

**The password to make the first access is your TAX CODE (CODICE FISCALE).**
The tax code was obtained from the electronic register; any errors must be communicated directly to the secretariat during opening hours.

At the first access, for security reasons, the system asks you to change the password to one of your choice and easy to remember.

### **the new password MUST have these characteristics**

- At least 8 characters including letters and numbers
- At least one UPPERCASE character
- At least one special character including . ! @ ? etc.

Once you have changed the password to your personal one, you have access to all the apps in the Suite.
